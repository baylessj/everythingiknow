# SEO Strategies

* use 301 redirects instead of 302 redirects for blog posts that are officially dead
* find a niche or two and stick with it
* don't use keywords that are too similar, they will confuse the google
* Priorities:
  1. **Easy wins -** These keywords are medium to high traffic, low competition, and high CPC. They’re the highest priority content pieces, so they are to be written ASAP.
  2. **Rewarding challenges** - These keywords are harder to rank, but can lead to insane results. They’re also medium to high traffic, high CPC, but are a lot more competitive \(and hard to rank for, if you’re just starting out with SEO\). As such, they were a secondary priority.
  3. **Nice-to-haves** - Pretty much everything else goes here. These keywords are worth pursuing, but they’re not as important as the other 2 priorities. They’re usually low to medium volume/relevance / CPC.
